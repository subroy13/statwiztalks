# Statwiztalks

This repository contains the slides, source materials for the talks I have presented over the years, based on multiple collaborative projects.


## 2023

- `multivariate-location-scatter`: This is an invited session for introduction to the robust multivariate estimation techniques (estimation of location and scatter) to a class on Robust Statistics in ISI, Kolkata.


## 2021

- `algorithmic-fairness` : A talk presented on August 14, 2021 during the final year of my M.Stat. at ISI, for the PCM Memorial Gold Medal Presentation. I discussed the fairness aspect of the statistical decision systems, various ethical issue, and how to quantify these seemingly qualitative aspects.

## 2020

- `mt-rainier-study`: A talk regarding a practical case study of different kinds of Regression Analysis. Many mountaineers aim to climb Mt. Rainier (located 59 miles south east of Seattle, Washington) during different times of the year, in different group sizes and via different routes. Based on the historical data on successful and failed climbing attempts in conjunction with the weather data, we analyze different types of regression model to model the success probability. This can prove useful to the mountaineers to avoid certain routes and certain weather conditions to assess the probability of a successful expedition.

- `causal-dag-intro`: This is talk prepared as a part of group class project for Categorical Data Analysis course during my M.Stat. in ISI, Kolkata. 
	* In this talk, we provide motivation of why Causal inference is needed through the example of Simpson's Paradox. We present the assumptions to perform Causal inference and introduce the setup of Directed Acyclic Graphs, related to Causal inferential methods. We also describe special types of Graphical models like Chain, Fork, Colliders and d-separation, and determine how we can test for these structures from the available data. We then see how we can estimate different causal effects using Backdoor and Frontdoor criterion, from these DAG structures, and finally we end with some real-life applications of the described methodology.
	* This is an extensive reading project based on the principals stated in the book *Causal Inference in Statistics: A Primer*, Judea Pearl, Madelyn Glymour, Nicholas P. Jewell. Wiley, 2016.



## 2019

- `tsne-visualization` is a talk given as a part of D. Basu. Gold Memorial Presentation Lectures on 13th December, 2019 at ISI Kolkata. This is about a basic introduction to the t-distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding (tSNE) algorithm, popularly used in dimensionality reduction.

- `regression-mixture` is a talk during my B.Stat. final year at ISI, as a part of reading project evaluation. It is about showing difficulties with estimation with mixture of regression models and a possible solution.
